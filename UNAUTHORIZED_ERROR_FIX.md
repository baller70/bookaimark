# Fix for Unauthorized Error Accumulation

## Problem
The application was experiencing an accumulating error count for `Error: Unauthorized` from the MediaLibrary component, where the error count would continuously increase (e.g., starting at 100 errors and counting up indefinitely).

## Root Cause
1. **React Strict Mode**: Next.js has `reactStrictMode: true` enabled, which causes effects to run twice in development mode
2. **Race Conditions**: Multiple simultaneous API calls to `/api/user-data/media` when user is not authenticated
3. **Continuous Retry**: The component was potentially being remounted or the effect was being triggered multiple times

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in UserDataService
```typescript
// lib/user-data-service.ts
async getMediaFiles(type?: string, page = 1, limit = 20): Promise<PaginatedResponse<UserMediaFile>> {
  const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/media?${params}`);
  
  // Handle authentication errors specifically
  if (response.status === 401) {
    throw new Error('Unauthorized');
  }
  
  const result = await response.json();
  // ... rest of method
}
```

### 2. Race Condition Prevention in MediaLibrary Component
```typescript
// src/features/media/components/MediaLibrary.tsx
const loadingRef = useRef(false);

const loadPersistentFiles = async () => {
  // Prevent multiple simultaneous calls using ref (works better than state for race conditions)
  if (loadingRef.current) {
    return;
  }
  
  try {
    loadingRef.current = true;
    setIsLoadingFiles(true);
    const response = await userDataService.getMediaFiles();
    setPersistentFiles(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    // Check if it's an authentication error (401)
    if (error instanceof Error && error.message.includes('Unauthorized')) {
      // Silently handle auth errors when user is not logged in
      console.warn('User not authenticated - skipping persistent files load');
      setPersistentFiles([]);
      return;
    }
    
    console.error('Failed to load persistent files:', error);
    setPersistentFiles([]); // Set empty array as fallback
  } finally {
    setIsLoadingFiles(false);
    loadingRef.current = false;
  }
};
```

### 3. Silent Authentication Error Handling
- Authentication errors (401 Unauthorized) are now handled silently with a warning instead of throwing errors
- The component gracefully falls back to an empty array when user is not authenticated
- No toast notifications are shown for authentication failures to avoid disrupting UX

## Benefits
1. **Eliminates Error Accumulation**: No more continuously increasing error counts
2. **Better Development Experience**: Cleaner console output during development
3. **Graceful Degradation**: App works properly whether user is authenticated or not
4. **Race Condition Prevention**: Uses useRef to prevent multiple simultaneous API calls
5. **React Strict Mode Compatible**: Handles double effect execution properly

## Testing
- Start the development server with `npm run dev`
- Navigate to pages that use the MediaLibrary component
- Verify that 401 errors are no longer accumulating in the console
- Confirm that the app works properly both when authenticated and unauthenticated

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - The unauthorized error accumulation issue has been fixed.
